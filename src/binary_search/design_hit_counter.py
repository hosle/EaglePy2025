# https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hit-counter/
#
#
# Design a hit counter which counts the number of hits received in the past 5 minutes (i.e., the past 300 seconds).
#
# Your system should accept a timestamp parameter (in seconds granularity), and you may assume that calls are being made to the system in chronological order (i.e., timestamp is monotonically increasing).
# Several hits may arrive roughly at the same time.
#
# Implement the HitCounter class:
#
# HitCounter() Initializes the object of the hit counter system.
# void hit(int timestamp) Records a hit that happened at timestamp (in seconds). Several hits may happen at the same timestamp.
# int getHits(int timestamp) Returns the number of hits in the past 5 minutes from timestamp (i.e., the past 300 seconds).
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input
# ["HitCounter", "hit", "hit", "hit", "getHits", "hit", "getHits", "getHits"]
# [[], [1], [2], [3], [4], [300], [300], [301]]
# Output
# [null, null, null, null, 3, null, 4, 3]
#
# Explanation
# HitCounter hitCounter = new HitCounter();
# hitCounter.hit(1);       // hit at timestamp 1.
# hitCounter.hit(2);       // hit at timestamp 2.
# hitCounter.hit(3);       // hit at timestamp 3.
# hitCounter.getHits(4);   // get hits at timestamp 4, return 3.
# hitCounter.hit(300);     // hit at timestamp 300.
# hitCounter.getHits(300); // get hits at timestamp 300, return 4.
# hitCounter.getHits(301); // get hits at timestamp 301, return 3.
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= timestamp <= 2 * 109
# All the calls are being made to the system in chronological order (i.e., timestamp is monotonically increasing).
# At most 300 calls will be made to hit and getHits.
